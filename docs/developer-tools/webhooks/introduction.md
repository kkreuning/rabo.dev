# Introduction

:::info v3 documentation only

This document describes the Rabo Smart Pay v3 webhooks mechanism.

If you are still using legacy webhooks, you are urged to
[migrate to v3 webhooks](./advanced-topics/migrating-to-v3-webhooks.md).

:::

Whenever an event of interest occurs, Rabo Smart Pay will inform you through its webhook mechanism.

This allows you to react to, for example, completion of orders, and then create a shipment, or send an e-mail to 
your customer.

If you are new to Rabo Smart Pay webhooks, start by understanding the [webhook lifecycle](./webhook-lifecycle.md).

When you are ready to integrate webhooks into your platform, see the [implementation guide](./implementation-guide.md).

In case you want to know how to manage your webhooks, see [managing subscriptions](./managing-subscriptions.md).
