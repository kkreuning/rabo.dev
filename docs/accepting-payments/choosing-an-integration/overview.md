# Overview

Rabo Smart Pay allows integrations on different levels:

1. Using a pre-build integration
2. Using the Hosted Checkout
3. Building your own integration
4. Using one of our integration partners

## Pre-built integration
If you are using an off-the-shelf e-commerce platform, you should use one of the pre-built integrations. Rabo Smart Pay
provides plugins, and extensions for most popular platforms.

This option requires the least amount of work on your part, but also provides less flexibility than a bespoke
integration.

See [Pre-build integrations](#) for more information.

## Hosted Checkout
Using the Hosted Checkout only requires you to integrate with the [Rabo Smart Pay SDK](#), and doesn't require any
front-end work on your part; you just announce an order, and redirect your customer to the Hosted Checkout.

This option is best suited for smaller webshops, or webshops that only sell a few specific products.

See [Hosted Checkout](./hosted-checkout.md) for more information.

## Build your own integration
Building your own integration provides the most flexibility, and is best suites for large, bespoke e-commerce platforms,
and in-app payments.

When going the BYOI route you should integrate using the [Rabo Smart Pay SDK](#), and optionally [SmartPay.js](#).
Alternatively, you can also integrate with our [APIs](../../developer-tools/api/openapi-specifications.md) directly.

## Using an integration partner
If you don't have the time, or resources to integrate with Rabo Smart Pay, one of our integration partners may be able
to help you.

See [Finding an integration partner](#) for more information.
